  ABSTRACT = {Synthetic datasets simultaneously allow for the dissemination of research data while protecting the privacy and confidentiality of respondents. Generating and analyzing synthetic datasets is straightforward, yet, a synthetic data analysis pipeline is seldom adopted by applied researchers. We outline a simple procedure for generating and analyzing synthetic datasets with the multiple imputation software mice (Version 3.13.15) in R. We demonstrate through simulations that the analysis results obtained on synthetic data yield unbiased and valid inferences and lead to synthetic records that cannot be distinguished from the true data records. The ease of use when synthesizing data with mice along with the validity of inferences obtained through this procedure opens up a wealth of possibilities for data dissemination and further research on initially private data.},
